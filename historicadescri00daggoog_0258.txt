Historia Br‘partito Hiberniae. Ir is written in verse and
prose, and grounded on O’Flolrertp's Ogipgr'o. From a modest,
well penned letter, dated Vienna, February 12, 1741, in answer

writings, and preferments. He writ besides, an Abridgment
t oinstory, Chronological, and Geographioal, under the title of,
Institutiones Academico, intended both for public use, and
sor the hails, when he was obliged to lecture on those matters.
Also, Speculum Imperr'ale, Hortorr‘oo-Cltrouologr'oumr Speculum
Heroldrouru. All these Tracts werepublished in Latio, and at
the date of the aforesaid letter, he had ready sor the press, a
,⁴ larger and more complete system 01 Philosophy, under the title

whether yet printed I know not.
